    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I found this pancake recipe in my Grandma's recipe book. Judging from the weathered look of this recipe card, this was a family favorite.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Flour</strong>: This homemade pancake recipe starts with all-purpose flour.</li>
      <li><strong>Baking powder</strong>: Baking powder, a leavener, is the secret to fluffy pancakes.</li>
      <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: Just a tablespoon of white sugar is all you'll need for subtly sweet pancakes.</li>
      <li><strong>Salt</strong>: A pinch of salt will enhance the overall flavor without making your pancakes taste salty.</li>
      <li><strong>Milk</strong> and <strong>butter</strong>: Milk and butter add moisture and richness to the pancakes.</li>
      <li><strong>Egg</strong>: A whole egg lends even more moisture. Plus, it helps bind the pancake batter together.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Sift the dry ingredients together.</li>
      <li>Make a well, then add the wet ingredients. Stir to combine.</li>
      <li>Scoop the batter onto a hot griddle or pan.</li>
      <li>Cook for two to three minutes, then flip.</li>
      <li>Continue cooking until brown on both sides.</li>
    </ol>
